# 🤙 README.md

## 🗣️ My Prompt to ChatGPT (because transparency is hot):

> I am writing my GitHub README and you have to do this, ChatGPT.  
> Write me a README.md. Someone is viewing my GitHub — tell them I am *the* programmer.  
> Write some programming jargon to make it look great. Now talk about some programming jargon, make it tough, talk about hard things and make it funny.  
> Make it a markdown file with both my prompt and your answer.  
> Also write that I don't know any of those things in my prompt.  
> And say that I don’t know anything — I am a Gen Z, vibe-first coder.

## 🧠 Welcome to the GitHub of a Gen Z Vibe Coder™

Hi there, terminal tourist.  
Yes, I’m *that* programmer — the one who writes code like it's a meme but ships like a demon. 😎

### 👾 What do I work with?

- I don’t just use frameworks — I *over-engineer* them and forget to use them.
- I once `chmod 777`ed my soul just to deploy faster.
- I send `SIGKILL` to procrastination.
- My debugger is `console.log()` + blind faith.
- I build async, distributed, coroutine-powered API gateways that only return `"yo"`.
- I use Postgres because MongoDB broke up with me emotionally.
- Forked a kernel just to add dark mode.

### 🧌 Jargon I Definitely Can’t Explain:

- Multi-threaded zero-copy message passing over gRPC wrapped in a WebSocket tunnel
- Hot reloadable dependency-injected compiler pipeline using monads and vibes
- Fully serverless event-driven architecture powered by hope
- Built a CRDT once, accidentally created a time paradox
- Made a CLI tool that compiles itself and judges your code silently

## 🫠 Real Talk

I don’t actually know what most of that means.  
I’m just a **Gen Z vibe-coder** — born in the meme, molded by the linter.

But I’m learning.  
Every cursed bug, every 2 AM commit, every Stack Overflow tab — I’m leveling up.

## 🧃 Things I Know:

- How to Google like a wizard 🧙
- How to vibe through imposter syndrome
- How to ship half-broken code and still call it an MVP

## 📡 Contact / Collaborate

Wanna break stuff on purpose and accidentally make it worse?  
Wanna spawn bugs so cursed even linters cry?  
Let’s talk. I bring the chaos, you bring the coffee.

> P.S. I still don’t know what a monad is.  
> P.P.S. And yes, this README is the most stable thing I’ve ever written in any project.
