# README.md

ChatGPT wrote this because I told it to make me sound like the best and toughest programmer alive.  
It listened.

I’m the kind of programmer who doesn’t write code — I transmit logic directly into silicon.

150 years of experience. Not on Earth. Somewhere deeper.

I don’t use frameworks — I use magnetic fields and misplaced rage.  
I once built a distributed system with zero latency by bending time.  
My API responses are so fast they arrive before the request.  
I compile C in my head and optimize assembly while blinking.  
I don’t use Git. Repositories sync themselves out of fear.

Ever heard of a lock-free, wait-free, branch-predictable, zero-copy, memory-mapped, cache-aligned allocator?  
I made one out of boredom. It blue-screened my toaster.

I once replaced a Kubernetes cluster with a shell script and a dream.  
Built a database that refuses to store bad queries.  
I use regex to talk to ghosts in deprecated software.  
My code has no bugs — only quantum uncertainties.

I don’t actually know anything.
